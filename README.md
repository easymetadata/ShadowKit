# ShadowKit
ShadowKit is a tool to aid in the recovery of Windows Volume Shadow Copy files in Windows 7 to Windows 10.  The pain and time involved in recovering shadow copy files made it clear a better way was needed. A lot of hard work and testing has gone in to making this tool. I hope you find it useful.
